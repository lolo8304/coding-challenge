I have started on week 1 in implementing the challenges starting March 2023. Since then John published every week a new challenge.

I love the most the real world applications as Redis, load balancer, webserver, IRC client, json parse, url shortener and more to come ....


I started to use Discort and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Lolo46822032) and https://github.com/CodingChallegesFYI/SharedSolutions to share my solutions.

I decided to implement it back with Java. I have been working with Java since v1.0 back in 2000 and worked with it professionally for more than 18 years. Then I started with C# and powershell working with Azure Cloud.

# Write your own

Here you can find all my implementation, challenge see: https://codingchallenges.fyi

Some feedback and and my personal complexity rating

    1 * = simple, 5 ***** = a real challenge

|  85  |                  BASIC, Assembler                  | Back in 1985 I learned to code in [BASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC) on [Sharp 1401](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharp_PC-1401) <br/>and with MS-DOS in 1985 on my 1st PC 4.77 Mhz, <br/>with a Hercules monochrome grafic card, <br/1MB RAM, 20MB Disk :-) and <br/>Floppies. And sure got to know [Assembly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language#Assembler) to do all crazy stuff down the low level.                                                                                                                                       |
|  87  |                       Pascal                       | With the [Apple Macintosh 512e](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_512Ke) used in highschool I started coding with [Pascal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Pascal) by [Niklaus Wirth](https://people.inf.ethz.ch/wirth). <br/>During an internship I used Pascal to run on an [VAX by DEC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VAX)                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
|  89  | [Modula-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modula-2) | Modula-2 as the successor of Pascal also by [Niklaus Wirth](https://people.inf.ethz.ch/wirth) and here I started all my private coding                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
|  90  |                        bash                        | with the usage of UNIX systems at ETHZ I started with scripting                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|  90  |                     C and C++                      | with the first university challenges I touched C and C++ but did not like it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |  
|  91  |             Oberon, Oberon-2, XOberon              | At University ETH Zurich I used to code in [Oberon](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oberon_(programming_language)>) by [Niklaus Wirth](https://people.inf.ethz.ch/wirth) and [Oberon-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oberon-2) <br/>the object oriented extension of Oberon and [XOberon](https://www.ifr.mavt.ethz.ch/research/xoberon/) at Institute of Robotics. I loved it.                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|  93  |                   Lisp + Prolog                    | Beside Oberon we use to code our first Neuronal network with 10 neurons in [Lisp](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp) <br/>and our first knowledge base in [Prolog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolog) - something completly different but nice.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|  94  |                     Smalltalk                      | At my first business job in 1994 I learned and loved [Smalltalk](https://people.inf.ethz.ch/wirth/Oberon/index.html) - the real object oriented language. <br/>In a private project, I even implemented my own Smalltalk parser, compiler and byte code runtime environment <br/>in Oberon based on the architecture and bytecode from [A little Smalltalk](https://rmod-files.lille.inria.fr/FreeBooks/LittleSmalltalk/ALittleSmalltalk.pdf). <br/>I also used [Visual-Age Smalltalk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VisualAge) in my STA in Dallas, TX, USA in 1999. |
| 2000 |                        Java                        | In 2000 I arrived at the WWW finally and I learned Java and [JDK 1.x](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_version_history) and used Java for more then 18 years in business and private.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 2011 |                 Javascript, NodeJs                 | During Hackathons I learned to code in [Javascript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript), [node.js](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node.js), [Solidy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solidity#:~:text=Solidity%20is%20the%20primary%20language,enterprise%2Doriented%20Hyperledger%20Fabric%20blockchain.)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 2014 |            Objective-C, Swift, Swift-UI            | with winning an innovation award in 2014 I started coding with Apple Objective-c for iPhone <br/>and Apple Watch Series 1 and later with Swift and SwiftUI for our winning Hackathon idea [m-clippy](https://devpost.com/software/m-clippy).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 2020 |                         C#                         | Coding for my beloved Hololens 1 developer edition I started with Unity and C#. <br/>Including Hackathons at Microsoft in Redmond with Principal engineers from the Hololens team. <br/>Implement 1st holographic bot called [LoloBot](https://github.com/lolo8304/LoloBot).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 2021 |                     Powershell                     | Then I arrived in the Azure Cloud and used [C#](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language)>) and [powershell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PowerShell) for more than 3 years now.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 2023 |                     Typescript                     | Now back at OpenAPIs development with Nodejs (nestjs) with typescript                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 2023 |                    Back in Java                    | Now for the Coding challenges I flipped back to Java. Unfortunatly Oberon and Smalltalk are almost dead.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

*** and maybe I forgot many languages I learned beside: German, French and English.

# Thank you

I wanted to thank John Cricket for these challenges and I encourage every Engineer from Junior to Principal to do this. Learn a new language or get back to language you have used to code (as me here in Java).

And also learn to understand real-world applications while writing your own version of it.

thx
Lolo
